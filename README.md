## Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator
This project takes a python list containing 9 elements and outputs
a dictionary containing the mean, variance, and standard deviation
across the rows, columns, and the flattened matrix. It does this by
using built-in numpy functionality.

### This project is part of the Freecodecamp Data Analysis course.
